            <p>The manipulative center allows children to strengthen fine motor skills through manipulating activities
                such as connecting toys, puzzles, and stringing toys. This center aids in increasing the attention span
                of children and allows them to explore shapes, numbers, and colors.</p>

            <p>The block center encourages children to engage in cooperative play while creating and building
                structures. Buildings, cities, and tracks are some of the many structures that children love to
                construct. This center will also become music and movement at various points in the day. Allowing
                children to explore varieties of music increases their cultural awareness as well as the awareness of
                the flexibility and different movements of their bodies.</p>
