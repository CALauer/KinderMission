        <p>The science/math center gives children a taste of nature and numbers. In this center children will be
            able to study and use natural items that are found right in their own backyard (pine cones, small logs,
            leaves) and use tools such as magnifying glasses to explore these items more in depth. Children will
            also be able to incorporate math into their learning through the many different shapes, colors, and
            counting that is involved with science.</p>

        <p>The block center encourages children to engage in cooperative play while creating and building
            structures. Buildings, cities, and tracks are some of the many structures that children love to
            construct. This center will also become music and movement at various points in the day. Allowing
            children to explore varieties of music increases their cultural awareness as well as the awareness of
            the flexibility and different movements of their bodies.</p>
