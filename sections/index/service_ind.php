        <p>We are so grateful for the opportunity to serve both parents and students to the best pre-school
            experience.
            At KMA we are focused on working with both students and parents because we know that parent involvement
            is
            essential for student success. Every child and every family is unique and we are looking forward to
            building
            a good relationship with your family and watching your child thrive.</p>
